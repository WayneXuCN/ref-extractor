# Ref Extractor

[Ref Extractor](http://rintze.zelle.me/ref-extractor/) is a website to extract Zotero references from Microsoft Word documents.
This can be useful if somebody sends you a Word document with Zotero references, and you'd like to add the cited items to your Zotero library.
Or maybe you lost access to your original Zotero library and wish to retrieve the items you cited in your own Word documents.

The tool only works with Word files in the .docx format for which "Store references in document" is checked in the Zotero document preferences.
Once you have successfully extracted the Zotero references from a document, the output file (in the CSL JSON format) can be imported into Zotero via Zotero's gear menu.
Select either "Import..." and select the output file, or open the file in a text editor, copy the file's content to the clipboard and select "Import from Clipboard".
